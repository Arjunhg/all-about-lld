--> In Java, this keyword is a built-in reference to the current object within a class methods or constructors. It makes the object's properties, methods, and other members accessible.

--> It provides several key features:
    : Disambiguation: The this keyword helps disambiguate between class members and local variables that have the same name as the class member. It ensures that the correct member is accessed. It resolves naming conflicts between instance variables and parameters or local variables.

    : Chaining: The this keyword allows method chaining (or constructor chaining), where you can call a method on the same object, which is useful when you want to perform multiple actions on the same object.

    : Passing reference: The this keyword can be used to pass a reference to the current object to other methods, constructors, or other parts of the class.

    : Dynamic Binding: The this keyword allows dynamic binding, which means that the behavior of a method or constructor is determined at runtime based on the object on which it is invoked.
