Explanation:
• TextEditor (Originator):

○ Holds the current text and can create a Memento via the save() method.

○ Restores its state using the restore(Memento m) method.

‍

• Memento:

○ Encapsulates the state of the TextEditor (i.e., the text) in an immutable way.

‍

• EditorHistory (Caretaker):

○ Manages two stacks (undoStack and redoStack) to support both undo and redo operations.

○ Provides methods to save new states and retrieve states for undo/redo without affecting the

TextEditor's internal logic.
