Explanation:

• The Patient interface declares the accept method, which every patient must implement.

• ChildPatient, AdultPatient, and SeniorPatient are the concrete classes that implement Patient. They delegate operations to a visitor.

• The Visitor interface declares a visit method for each patient type.

• DiagnosisVisitor, BillingVisitor, and HealthReportVisitor are concrete visitors that implement the operations (diagnosis, billing, health reporting) for each patient type.

• The inheritance relationships show that the concrete patients realize the Patient interface, and the concrete visitors realize the Visitor interface.

• The line Patient ..> Visitor : accepts represents a dependency relationship, indicating that a Patient uses (or "accepts") a Visitor to perform operations. 

In the UML diagram you shared, the **two different kinds of lines** represent different relationships between classes and interfaces.

Let's break them down:

---

### ✅ **1. Solid Line with Hollow Triangle (Inheritance / Implementation)**

* **Meaning:** "Is-a" relationship.
* **Used for:**

  * Class → Interface: Indicates **implementation**.
  * Class → Class or Interface → Interface: Indicates **inheritance** (extends).
* **In your diagram:**

  * `ChildPatient`, `AdultPatient`, and `SeniorPatient` have solid lines with hollow triangles pointing to `Patient` ⇒ These classes **implement the `Patient` interface**.
  * `DiagnosisVisitor`, `BillingVisitor`, and `HealthReportVisitor` have solid lines with hollow triangles pointing to `Visitor` ⇒ These classes **implement the `Visitor` interface**.

---

### 🔄 **2. Dashed Line with Open Arrowhead (Association / Usage)**

* **Meaning:** "Uses-a" or **dependency** relationship.

* **Used for:** A class **depends on another class/interface temporarily**, often as a parameter or within a method.

* **In your diagram:**

  * The `accept(visitor: Visitor)` method in each patient class **uses the `Visitor` interface**, shown by the dashed line from `Patient` to `Visitor` with an "accepts" label.
  * This means: Patients accept Visitors and call the `visit()` method on them.

### 🧠 In short:

| Line Style                          | Meaning                      | Interpretation                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Solid line with hollow triangle** | Inheritance / Implementation | "Is-a" (e.g., class implements interface)    |
| **Dashed line with open arrowhead** | Association / Dependency     | "Uses-a" (e.g., method parameter, field use) |

---

This distinction is **crucial in design patterns like Visitor**, where behavior is separated from the data structure, and dependencies are carefully managed.
