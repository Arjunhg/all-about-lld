📋 UML Diagram Analysis - Template Design Pattern

🔍 What the Diagram Shows:
    • The Diagram.png illustrates a classic Template Design Pattern implementation
    • Features two concrete beverage classes inheriting from an abstract base class

🏗️ Class Structure:
    • Abstract Base Class: Beverage
      ├── Defines the template method: prepareRecipe()
      ├── Provides common implementations: boilWater()
      └── Provides common implementations: pourInCup()
    
    • Concrete Subclasses:
      ├── CoffeeBeverage
      └── TeaBeverage

⚡ Key Implementation Details:
    • Both subclasses inherit from the abstract Beverage class
    • Template method prepareRecipe() is defined in the parent class
    • Common methods (boilWater, pourInCup) are shared across subclasses
    • Variable methods are implemented by each subclass:
      ├── brew() - customized per beverage type
      └── addCondiments() - specific to each beverage

🎯 Pattern Benefits:
    • Code reuse through shared common methods
    • Consistent algorithm structure via template method
    • Flexibility for subclasses to customize specific steps
