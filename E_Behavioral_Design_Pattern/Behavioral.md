## ✅ Behavioral Pattern Similarities

Behavioral patterns do often have similar structures because they all deal with **communication between objects**. The key differences are in their **intent** and **specific use cases**.

## 🔍 Key Differences Between Similar Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Primary Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Mediator** | **Centralizes communication** between multiple objects | When many objects need to communicate in complex ways |
| **Command** | **Encapsulates requests** as objects | When you need to parameterize, queue, or log requests |
| **Iterator** | **Provides sequential access** to elements | When you need to traverse collections without exposing their structure |
| **Observer** | **One-to-many dependency** between objects | When one object changes state, many others need to be notified |




## 🧠 Insight

1. **Patterns have similar structures** but different intents
2. **You don't need to memorize syntax** - understand the concepts
3. **Implementation matters more than terminology** for practical use
4. **Choose patterns based on requirements**, not just because they exist

## 💡 Pro Tip for Interviews/Real World

When discussing design patterns:
- Focus on **the problem you're solving**
- Explain **why** you chose a particular pattern
- Mention **alternatives you considered** and why you rejected them
- Emphasize the **benefits** (decoupling, maintainability, extensibility)

They're **tools for solving specific problems**, not rigid templates to be memorized. 🚀
